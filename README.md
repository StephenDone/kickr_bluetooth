# kickr_bluetooth

## Introduction
This repository contains information on how to connect to the KICKR Bike via Bluetooth Smart / BLE.
As I discover more about the bike, I will add the information here.

## Documentation
See the [Wiki](../../wiki) for documentation. 

## Background
As a separate project that is not on GitHub, I have been writing an indoor cycling data logging app for my (KICKR) bike, my Heart Rate Monitor and my muscle oxygenation sensors (Train.Red).
Since my KICKR bike is the only Bluetooth enabled indoor trainer I have access to, I have been investigating what features it has, that I can make use of in my app.
